## Getting Started
Install package
```sh
npm install yeelight-service
```
or

Install and save in package.json
```sh
npm install yeelight-service --save
```

## Usage and examples

### Import YeelightService
```typescript
import { YeelightService } from 'yeelight-service';
const yeelightService = new YeelightService();
```

### Subscribing to devices
This function subscribes to all devices connected to current WiFi. Event will be executed each time, a new device is connected.
```typescript
yeelightService.devices.subscribe((devices) => {
    // executed each time device is connected
    // do something with devices
});
```

### Get device by name
This function gets device by name. If there are multiple devices with given name, only the first one will be returned.
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByName('deviceName').subscribe((device) => {
    // executed when device will be found
    // do something with device
});
```

### Get device by model
This function gets device by model. If there are multiple devices with given model, only the first one will be returned.
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
    // executed when device will be found
    // do something with device
});
```

### Subscribing to device property
You can subscribe to device property (e.g. subscribe to power state)
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
    device.power.subscribe((powerState) => {
        // executed each time power state change
        // do something with power state
    });
});
```
Or you can get power state just once
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
    const power = device.power.value;
    // do something with power state
});
```
If you want to observe more than one property, do it in RXJS-way. For example, if you want to be notified each time when `connection status`, `power state` OR `brightness` change, you can use RXJS `combineLatest`.

```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
    combineLatest(
        device.connected,
        device.power,
        device.brightness
    ).pipe(
        map(([connected, power, brightness]) => {
            return { connected, power, brightness };
        })
    ).subscribe((data) => {
        // executed each time `connected`, `power` or `brightness` change
        // do something with data
    });
});
``` 

### Changing property of device
Every function changing any device property returns promise object with operation status. 

```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
    device.setPower('on').then((result) => {
        // do something with result
    });
});
```

## Types
Interface file: `'yeelight-service/lib/yeelight.interface'`

Example (log to console after changing power state failed):
```typescript
import { YeelightService } from 'yeelight-service';
import {
    IYeelight,
    IYeelightDevice,
    IYeelightMethodResponse,
    YeelightMethodStatusEnum
} from 'yeelight-service/lib/yeelight.interface';

const yeelightService: IYeelight = new YeelightService();
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device: IYeelightDevice) => {
    device.setPower('on').then((result: IYeelightMethodResponse) => {
        if (result.status === YeelightMethodStatusEnum.OK) {
            return;
        }

        if (result.errorMessage) {
            console.log(result.errorMessage);
            return;
        }

        console.log(`Unexpected error occured. Error code: ${ result.status }`);
    });
});
```

## Performance
If you want to terminate the service, please use `destroy` function. It will close all devices sockets, as well as main service socket itself.
```typescript
yeelightService.destroy();
```

You can close connection of single device, by using `destroy` function on device. Example:
```typescript
yeelightService.devices.subscribe((devices) => {
    devices.forEach(() => {
        const deviceName = device.name.value;
        const deviceConnected = device.connected.value;

        if (!deviceConnected) {
            return;
        }

        if (deviceName !== 'myDevice') {
            device.destroy();
        }

        // do something with device `myDevice` knowing, that every other device is disconnected from socket
    });
});
```

## Methods
Not all of methods from official Yeelight API are supported. If you need method that is not on the list to be part of the package, please create [github issue](https://github.com/faustyn-p/yeelight-service/issues), or you can use `sendCommand` method described below.

### setName
Set name of the device. Only parameter is new name of the device. Method returns Promise with status code and error (if occured).

```typescript
@param {string} name
@returns {Promise<IYeelightMethodResponse>}
device.setName(name);
```

### setPower
Turn on or off the device. Only required parameter is new state of the device. Method returns Promise with status code and error (if occured). See also [togglePower](#togglePower).

```typescript
@param {YeelightPowerState} power
@param {YeelightEffect} effect
@param {number} duration
@returns {Promise<IYeelightMethodResponse>}
device.setPower(power, effect, duration);
```

### setColorTemperature
