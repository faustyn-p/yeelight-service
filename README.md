## Getting Started

Install package
```sh
npm install yeelight-service
```
or

Install and save in package.json
```sh
npm install yeelight-service --save
```

## Usage and examples

### Import YeelightService
```typescript
import { YeelightService } from 'yeelight-service';
const yeelightService = new YeelightService();
```

### Subscribing to devices
This function subscribes to all devices connected to current WiFi. Event will be fired each time, a new device is connected.
```typescript
yeelightService.devices.subscribe((devices) => {
	// do something with devices
});
```

### Get device by name
This function gets device by name. If there are multiple devices with given name, only the first one will be returned.
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByName('deviceName').subscribe((device) => {
	// do something with device
});
```

### Get device by model
This function gets device by model. If there are multiple devices with given model, only the first one will be returned.
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
	// do something with device
});
```

### Subscribing to device property
You can subscribe to device property (e.g. subscribe to power state)
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
	device.power.subscribe((powerState) => {
		// this code will be executed each time power state of the device changes
	});
});
```
Or you can get power state just once
```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
	const power = device.power.value;
});
```
If you want to observe more than one property, do it in rxjs-way.

### Changing property of device
Every function changing any device property returns promise object with operation status. 

```typescript
yeelightService.getDeviceByModel('lamp1').subscribe((device) => {
	device.setPower('on').then((result) => {
		// do something with result
	});
});
```
